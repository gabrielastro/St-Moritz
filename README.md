_Suite of Tools to Model Observations of accRetIng planeTZ_

This collects a few simple functions or scripts that can be useful for studying accreting (forming) planets.

## Contents

The files are organised by language (`gnuplot` (4.2/5), `idl` (8.7), `python` (2.7); other versions might/should work too).

1. `Rp_from_Mdot_Mp_Popsynthfit.*`: planet radius as a function of accretion rate and mass, from the population syntheses of [Mordasini et al. (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...547A.112M), as fit by Aoyama, Marleau, Mordasini & Ikoma (2020, subm.)
